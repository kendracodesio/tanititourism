    <p className="mt-2 intro">Tucked away in the South Pacific lies the small, tropical island of Taniti. Although the
        island covers less than 500 square miles, the island's terrain is impressively diverse, containing both sandy and
        rocky beaches, a small but secure harbor, lush tropical rainforests, as well as a mountainous interior that
        includes a small active volcano.</p>
    <p className="intro">In keeping with the wondrous and varied landscape, the island also offers a wide range of indoor and outdoor
        activities, accommodations, and restaurants. So whether you're coming for adventure, romance, relaxation, or maybe a bit of all
        three, you'll easily find that and more in Taniti!</p>
